**Ashita** is designed to be self-contained and easy to install (and uninstall). We do not use a traditional installer that places additional unwanted files on your system. Instead, everything for **Ashita** is managed in a single folder and can be easily uninstalled by simply deleting the single folder.

Before downloading and running **Ashita**, please make sure that you have the needed [system requirements](/installation/requirements/).

**Please note:** At this time, **Ashita** v4 does not have a graphical launcher that auto-updates like v3. During this phase of beta testing, installation and updating is done manually instead.
